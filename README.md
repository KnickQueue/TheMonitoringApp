# Service Health Monitoring App

This Flask application pings a collection of services and displays their latency on a single dashboard of graphs. Each service is checked once per minute and the last hour of results is shown.

## Features

- Dashboard web page with a graph for each service
- Background thread that pings services every minute and stores the last hour of latency values
- Test mode that generates random latency values without making network requests

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ and `pip` are installed on your Ubuntu server.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the dashboard.

## Environment Variables

- `TEST_MODE=1` â€“ Do not run real ping commands and instead use random latency values. Useful if the server does not have internet access or while developing.

## Adding Services

Edit the `SERVICES` dictionary in `app.py` to change or add service URLs. The hostname of each URL is pinged to measure response time.

## History Graphs

The dashboard shows a small graph for each service representing the last hour of
ping results (one check per minute). Latency is shown in milliseconds and the
graphs update automatically.

## Disclaimer

The built-in ping checks are simplistic and may not reflect the real status of each provider. For production use, replace `measure_latency` with logic specific to each service's official status API or performance metrics.
